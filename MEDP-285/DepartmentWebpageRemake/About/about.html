        <h2>Student Success</h2>
        <p>
          he size of our department has enabled us to maintain strong ties to our students. From the beginning, we have nurtured our
          talented students. Many of them have gone on to become leaders of industry, researchers, and entrepreneurs. Some, like Ran
          Davidi (CUNY), Pascal Abadie (CUNY), Barry Schiffman (Columbia), and Matt Blaze (Princeton), went to graduate school and
          earned their doctorates in computer science. Others decided to pursue other careers. Eileen Twiggs, for example, who was
          the Hunter valedictorian when she graduated, went to Yale Law School, and Charles Davi, to NYU Law School.
        </p>

        <p>
          Others started on the path of entreneurship, like Anthony Volodkin, who created the <a href="http://hypem.com/">HypeMachine.com</a> website, or
          Andrey Butov, who founded Antair, Inc.  Matt Blaze made the headlines of major newspapers for his discoveries of
          major flaws in telecommunications security. Several of our students have received national recognition, such as the
          placing as finalists or receiving honorable mentions in the national CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Award in 2005 (Charles Davi)
          and 2003 (Marius Leordeanu, Anton Morozov, Tiziana Ligorio).
        </p>

            Several of our students have received <strong>national recognition</strong>, placing as finalists or honorable mentions in the
            national CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Award in 2003 and 2005.
          </p>
         </div>

         <p>
           Our students have been accepted to many prestigious graduate institutions, such as Carnegie-Mellon, Yale, Princeton, Harvard,
           and Columbia. Several are currently working on their doctorates in the CUNY Graduate Center under the tutelage of distinguished
           professors such as Gabor Herman. Still others obtained master's degrees and then went into industry.
         </p>

         <p>
           Many of our students work full- or part-time jobs while they go to school. Hunter is conveniently located on the upper east side of Manhattan,
           making it the ideal choice for many people who work and attend school at the same time. Companies often seek interns from our department for
           this reason, and many of our students take on internships and eventually work for the companies in which they interned. Our department has
           had relationships with several companies over the years, and many of our former students have started their careers in these companies.

        <h2>History of the Computer Science Department</h2>
        <p>
          Hunter College created the Computer Science Department in 1981 by selecting five faculty
          members from the Mathematics Department, hiring Thomas Wesselkamper from Virginia Polytechnic
          Institute as chairperson, transferring one faculty member from the School of Health Sciences,
          and recruiting two junior faculty members. Two of our current faculty, Professors Daniel Cohen
          and Christina Zamfirescu, were among those chosen from the Math Department, and a third, Prof.
          Virginia Teller, was one of the junior people hired that year. A third faculty member from the Math
          Department, Prof. Howard Rubin, served as the chairperson from 1995 to 2000. The Department was
          initially envisioned to have thirteen to fifteen faculty members; that dream has been achieved, and
          there are now fifteen faculty members, with over <strong>30 adjunct faculty</strong>!
        </p>

        <p>
          The Department grew and occasionally shrunk over the next thirty years: Some of the original faculty
          left or retired; Constantin Negoita joined it in 1983 and retired in 2011; Susan Epstein, in 1984;
          Stewart Weiss, in 1987; Cullen Schaffer, in 1990; Chris Ward, in 1993; Subash Shankar in 1999; William Sakas
          and Eric Schweitzer in 2000; and Ioannis Stamos, in 2001. Chris Ward left in 1996 to join the IBM T.J. Watson
          Research Laboratory. Saad Mneinmeh joined as a visiting assistant professor in 2006, Felisa Vazquez-Abad
          joined the faculty in 2009, and Lei Xie, in 2010.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under Prof. Wesselkamper's leadership, several initiatives were undertaken, including a Women in Computer
          Science Program and the creation of a Master's degree program. <strong>The program was suspended in 1993 and currently
          does not accept admissions.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1990, with Sun workstations he acquired through a successful grant proposal to the National Science Foundation,
          Prof. Weiss established the Department's first research laboratory, and began planning the installation of one of
          the College's first departmental local area networks with the help of Prof. Mihaly Mezei from the Chemistry Department.
          In the summer of 1991, Prof. Weiss <strong>single-handedly</strong> pulled the cables and installed the network, connecting the
          Department to the Arpanet. A second large grant awarded to the Department in 1993 as a result of a joint proposal
          by Profs. Epstein, Teller, and Weiss enabled the Department to acquire several more Sun workstations and create the
          Faculty Research Laboratory, which continues to be a vital research laboratory under grants received from the National
          Science Foundation by Prof. Epstein. The arrival of Chris Ward in 1993 boosted the support network even further, as he
          was instrumental in upgrading the LAN and improving its overall performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the stewardship of Prof. Rubin, the department acquired a lab known as "Lab G" that would eventually become the
          departmental UNIX laboratory. At the time that it was created, it contained only Windows hosts, and all college students
          could use it, but it contained software needed by computer science majors and improved the computing environment for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Ioannis Stamos joined the department in 2001, he also added to the research facilities in the department. His work,
          in image processing and reconstruction, required high-end workstations, which the college provided for him, and which
          he also acquired through grants from the National Science Foundation. His machines added storage capacity to the research network.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2005, the Department forged a partnership with the Departments of Biology and Mathematics and Statistics to enhance the
          science curriculum in the area of quantitative and computational biology. The initiative created a bioinformatics concentration
          in each discipline. One outcome of this partnership was a change in the nature of Lab G; the lab was outfitted with new workstations
          that dual-booted Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Windows XP, and students enrolled in almost all computer science classes were given
          accounts on the department UNIX network. Moreover, it became a place where CS students could "hang their hats," since no one had
          access to this lab except those students who had accounts on the system. One year later, the department decided to convert the lab
          to a Linux-only lab, which remains to this day.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Prof. Vázquez-Abad joined the department in 2009, funds were allocated to build a lab for her as well as to renovate Lab G. In
          2012, the new lab and renovation of Lab G were completed.
