        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <hr>

        <h3>What am I getting myself into?</h3>
        <p>
          The computer science major requires a minimum of five semesters; most entry-level full-time students need
          eight semesters to complete the CSCI and MATH requirements. Unless you own or have access to an Internet-accessing
          computer outside of school, you will be spending a lot of time on campus. The major also requires substantial
          mathematics, both within our own courses and from the Mathematics Department. Most successful computer science
          students are comfortable with math.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>What programming languages will I learn?</h3>
        <p>
          It is currently the policy of the Department to teach only C++ on the introductory
          level (CSCI 13500).  Some Assembly language is taught in CSCI 12700 and 26000.
          LISP is taught in most sections of CSCI 35000 (Artificial Intelligence), PROLOG
          in some Honors seminars; SQL in CSCI 43500 (Databases), and Processing in 26700.
          PERL is taught in CSCI 13200.  Advanced Programming Languages). Other than that, students
          are expected to learn new languages and applications primarily on their own.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>How do I start?</h3>
        <p>
          Most students who want to major in computer science should start by taking CSCI 12700. This is the
          beginning of the undergraduate sequence in computer science, including the basics of programming.
          Students with some prior background in computer science may have CSCI 12700 waived as a prerequisite
          for a particular class. If you think you fall into this category, see the class instructor or department
          chair for permission.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><i>Computer Science Minors:</i></strong> A computer science minor is a great way to learn something about the field, including how
          to write serious programs that will be of use in your major field. Interested? <a href="../Curriculum/undergraduate_program.html#CSCI_minor">Click
          here for more information.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong><i>FOR NON-MAJORS:</i></strong> Students who do not plan to major in computer science can still find
          many introductory level courses to help get them started. You can view our <a href="../Curriculum/courses.html">course catalog</a> for
          more information.
        </p>

        <h3>How Can I declare my Major?</h3>
        <p>
          As of Fall 2014, there are no prerequisite courses necessary to declare a Computer Science major concentration of study.
          We ask that prospective majors come by the department office (Hunter North room 1008) with a completed declaration form and a paper
          copy of their unofficial transcript downloaded from CUNYfirst.
          <br>
          <strong>Students interested in declaring a CSCI major with a concentration in Bioinformatics (quBI) should speak with Professor Saad Mneimneh.</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What do these "course numbers" mean?</h3>
        <p>
          The course numbers are there for your guidance. The prerequisite courses are on the 100 level. The core courses required for the
          major include two streams: the 13500-23500-33500 sequence (programming, data structures and algorithms), and the 16000-26000 sequence
          (architecture and logic design).
          <br><br>
          <strong>You MUST take these courses in numerical order!</strong>
          <br><br>
          300-level courses are appropriate for upper-level majors, and 400-level courses are for those who have special interest in their content
          or who have exhausted the 300-level electives. Courses numbered 395.xx (our rotating Topics courses) and 493xx (our Honors Seminar courses)
          are different every semester.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>How well do I have to perform in my Major Courses?</h3>
        <p>
          Each of the required and elective courses which count toward the major (including MATH/STAT courses) must be completed with a grade
          of C or better. The Department of Computer Science does not award final grades of CR (credit) in any CSCI courses to be used toward
          the major, from CSCI 13500 through the 400-level courses. In addition, you will be expected to maintain a minimum grade point average
          of 2.0 in all courses required for the major.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Please note that, for Computer Science majors, "D" is not considered a passing grade in any Computer Science or Math/Stat course.</strong>
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>What does it take complete a major?</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="../Curriculum/undergraduate_program.html#CSCI_major">Please view the major requirements on the undergraduate program webpage</a>.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Do I really need to take these prerequisites for some courses?</h3>
        <p>
          All course prerequisites are carefully determined by the faculty. If you take a course without the proper background,
          you will not be prepared to do the work and it is <strong>very unlikely</strong> you will succeed.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h3>What is Independent Study?</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to pursue up to three credits of Independent Study (CSCI 39100, 39200 or 39300) in an area not covered in any
          course offered by the Department. This option is available only to declared computer science majors who have successfully
          completed at least 18 CSCI credits. Each Independent Study course takes the form of a project which must be fully specified
          and clearly defined before registration, and must be sponsored and supervised by a member of the Department who will be the
          one to submit a final grade for the student.
          <br><br>
          <strong>No student may do for Independent Study credit a project whose goal is to learn a new language!</strong>
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>What if I already know a lot?</h3>
        <p>
          The Department will permit you to test out of CSCI 12700, CSCI 13500 and / or CSCI 15000. If you can pass the
          Test-out Exam with a grade of B or better, we will award you Credit by Exam for that course and permit you
          to take more advanced courses as if you had completed the course successfully. If you feel you are sufficiently
          expert in the course material covered in CSCI 12700, CSCI 13500 or CSCI 15000, come to the Department Office and
          ask for a copy of the Test-out Guidelines and an application form. Tests are scheduled at the mutual convenience of
          both the student and the proctor. For more information <a href="./test_out.html">click here</a>.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Please note that if you have already taken these courses at Hunter and failed them, you will not be allowed to take the test-out exam.</strong>
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Can I receive a degree with honors in Computer Science?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, you can receive a degree with honors in Computer Science if the following requirements are met:
          <ol>
            <li>Get a 2.7 Grade Point Average over all your courses at Hunter</li>
            <li>Obtain a 3.5 Grade Point Average in your Computer Science and Math courses at Hunter</li>
            <li>Receive A grade of 'A' in a Computer Science Honors seminar course (CSCI 493.xx)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Can I take more than one Computer Science/Math course at a time?</h3>
        <p>
          If you have no prior programming experience and/or your math background is not substantial, we strongly suggest that
          you start slowly: <strong>programming courses require a great deal of time and a lot of effort</strong>. The three 100-level courses
          are the foundations on which virtually all of our other courses are built, so the material in these courses should be
          understood thoroughly before you go on to a higher level. It is important to remember that the prerequisites listed for
          each course are the foundations for that course.

          <br><br>
          <strong>Your class schedule MUST NOT be put together based solely on the fact that classes are offered on the same days!</strong>

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What minors can I take to complement my Computer Science Major?</h3>
        <p>
          Although minors are not required by either Computer Science department of Hunter College, it is
          important to prospective employers and when applying to graduate schools.  Computer Science students are encouraged to minor in a field they find interesting. Minors that have been
          beneficial to Computer Science students in the past include:
