            <hr>
            <h2>Diversity of Interest and Exploration</h2>
            <p>
              Research interests within the department span many areas, including computational biology and bioinformatics,
              computer vision and image processing, computational linguistics and psycholinguistics, machine learning and
              knowledge representation,  program verification, and graph theory.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Computer Vision & Computer Graphics</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Ioannis Stamos</strong> is working in the areas of computer vision and computer graphics.
              His current research interests are in the broad area of photorealistic 3D model acquisition and the
              utilization of dense range 3D data. He has been working on range image segmentation, 3D modeling, and
              range to image registration algorithms. His work is concentrated on the reconstruction of urban
              environments from a combination of 3D range and 2D image sensing.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Bioinformatics & Artifical Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Susan Epstein's</strong> research seeks pragmatic solutions to hard problems. She and her students
              are currently at work on constraint satisfaction, pattern discovery for bioinformatics, and natural language
              dialog for a real-world environment. These are challenging and exciting projects that involve thinking about
              how people do things and the role that visualization plays in our ability to reason. As a result, her work in
              artificial intelligence is primarily directed to knowledge representation (how to describe the world to a machine)
              and machine learning (how a machine can improve its performance based on its experience). Many undergraduate
              researchers have started their careers under Prof. Epstein's tutelage and have since entered doctoral programs
              in computer science.
            </p>

            <h3>Switching Algorithms & Computational Biology</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Saad Mneimneh</strong> works on switching algorithms and networks and he is part of the Quantitative
              Biology program in Hunter conducting research in computational biology. He has also spent time developing
              new pedagogy to bring a level of mathematical thinking into courses such as computer programming, computer
              networks, and discrete structures, in order to develop critical and formal thinking skills.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Computational Biology & Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Stewart Weiss</strong> is also involved in computational biology and has been studying protein structure
              prediction algorithms. This is a relatively new interest for him. Prior to this, he was involved in the creation
              and analysis of psychometric algorithms for diagnostic eye testing as well as algorithms for 3D reconstruction
              of corneal topography from 2D images. He spent many years in the field of software testing and formal methods
              in software engineering before turning his attention to these other areas.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Formal Methods</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Subash Shankar</strong> is presently working in the area of formal methods for software and embedded systems.
              His current projects focus on static analysis and formal verification of reactive languages used to describe embedded
              systems. In support of these projects, he is also developing languages for high-level constraint-based reasoning
              over graphically structured data.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Computer Models Of Human Language & Human Language Acquisition</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>William Sakas</strong> is interested in computer models of human language and human language acquisition.
              One important research question that he is trying to answer is, what are the critical and fundamental components
              of a computational model of language and how accurately are they correlated with empirical psycholinguistic data?
              His research methods draw from computational linguistics, computational psycholinguistics, machine learning,
              probabilistic modeling, corpus analysis, psycholinguistics, linguistic theory and computational learning theory.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Computational Linguistics & Bioinformatics</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Virginia Teller</strong> spent most of her research career in computational linguistics. In her role as department chair,
              she has turned her attention to computer science education, and has spent considerable effort in co-creating the Bioinformatics
              track in computer science and in trying to increase the numbers of women and minorities in the PhD pipeline. She, Stewart Weiss,
              and Mary Flanagan (formerly of the Department of Film and Media Studies) were co-PIs on an NSF-sponsored project with this as its
              objective.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Graph Theory & Networks</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Christina Zamfirescu's</strong> most recent research focuses on two directions, both within graph theory and networks.
              One is involved with intersection digraphs, a concept she introduced with L.W. Beineke, and its connections to transformation
              digraphs and system complexity measures. The other one deals with the hamiltonicity of topological grid graphs.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Eric Schweitzer</strong> is the resident tinkerer and philosopher. He is a mathematician and logician, but spends
              much of his time in the hardware lab building this and that, and trying to get our students to do the same. He is sure
              that this polar dichotomy explains his current infatuation with quantum computing.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Computer Science, Intellectual Property Rights & The Law</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Daniel Cohen</strong> has written books on combinatorics, formal languages, and automata theory, and has worked
              in discrete mathematics for most of his career. Late in his career, he studied law and passed his bar exams, and now
              studies the fuzzy areas between computer science, intellectual property rights, and the law. He relishes an audience
              and has guided many undergraduates in their post-graduate career paths.
